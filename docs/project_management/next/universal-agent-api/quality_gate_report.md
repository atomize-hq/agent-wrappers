# Quality Gate Report — Universal Agent API

Status: Draft  
Date (UTC): 2026-02-16  
Reviewer: <TBD>

This report is required before execution triads begin. It must be produced by a third-party reviewer
running the planning lint checklist. Until reviewed, this file MUST NOT claim acceptance.

RECOMMENDATION: FLAG FOR HUMAN REVIEW

## Evidence checklist (reviewer fills)

- [ ] All Planning Pack artifacts exist (plan/tasks/session/spec_manifest/impact_map/ci_checkpoint_plan/specs/kickoffs).
- [ ] `decision_register.md` exists and pins all non-trivial choices (no ambiguity in specs).
- [ ] `tasks.json` wiring matches `sequencing.json` and CI checkpoint boundaries.
- [ ] Cross-platform plan is feasible on GitHub-hosted runners (no self-hosted requirements).
- [ ] Specs are singular/testable and do not contradict ADR 0009.

## Notes

- Update `RECOMMENDATION:` to `ACCEPT` only after review.
