You are starting Workstream E (MCP + App Server), Task E1-design-mcp-app.
Goal: design APIs/lifecycle for spawning codex mcp-server and app-server over stdio, covering codex/codex-reply and app thread/turn flows.
Resources: workstreams/E_mcp_app_server/BRIEF.md, workstreams/E_mcp_app_server/tasks.json, DeepWiki notes in BACKLOG.md.
Deliverable: design note/doc comments committed to repo; note reliance on Workstream A env-prep for spawning.
