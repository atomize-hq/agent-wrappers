You are starting Workstream H (Docs + Examples), Task H1-plan-docs.
Goal: plan documentation and example coverage for new features (bundled binary/CODEX_HOME, streaming API, MCP/app-server, feature detection).
Resources: workstreams/H_docs_examples/BRIEF.md, workstreams/H_docs_examples/tasks.json, README.md, crates/codex/EXAMPLES.md.
Deliverable: a doc plan note committed to repo.
