You are starting Workstream D (JSON Streaming + Logging), Task D1-design-stream-types.
Goal: design typed JSONL event API and streaming surface for `codex exec --json`, covering thread/turn/item lifecycle and item variants.
Resources: workstreams/D_json_stream_logging/BRIEF.md, workstreams/D_json_stream_logging/tasks.json, crates/codex/src/lib.rs, DeepWiki notes in BACKLOG.md.
Deliverable: event type definitions and API sketch (doc comments or design note) committed to the repo.
